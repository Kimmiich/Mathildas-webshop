# Mathildas webshop

This is a exercise where my classmate Mathilda designed a website and my task was to code that site.

Visit @Mathildap to see more of her work!

Mathilda also got to code a design of mine. Check it out [here.](https://mathildap.github.io/GEBLOD/)

## Launch demo

A demo of the site is provided through github pages and can be seen [here.](https://kimmiich.github.io/Mathildas-webshop/)

## Installation

> Feel free to clone this repo and look at it locally.

I recommend using **VS code**, there you can use the live-server option too see local changes etc.

## Other details

This is not a real site and has no real shopping functions.
